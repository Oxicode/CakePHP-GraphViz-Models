CakePHP GraphViz Models


This is a CakePHP shell that will find all models in your CakePHP application and
plugins, figure out the relationships between them, and will build a nice graph,
visualzing those relationships for you.

It supports CakePHP 1.2, CakePHP 1.3, and sometimes even CakePHP 2.0.  But there 
are numerous ways it can fail to work for you.  If it does fail, please let me
know and I'll try to fix it.


Intallation


1. Save the source of the script as app/vendors/shells/graph.php
2. There is no step 2.



Requirements


Since version 2.0 (Blue Octopus On Steroids), this script relies on Image/Graphviz
PEAR package, rather than directly on the command-line dot tool.  If you are using
a real operating system, you probably already have Image/GraphViz installed.  If
not, fetch with Yum, pear, or whatever is that your favourite tool for the job.



Usage


The simplest way to use this shell is just to run it via CakePHP console:

 $ php -f cake/console/cake.php graph

This should generate a graph.png image in your current directory.  Please have a look.

If you need more control, there are two options that this shell understand from the
command line: filename and format.   You can use either the filename option like so:

 $ php -f cake/console/cake.php graph /tmp/my_models.png

Or you can use both options together like so:

 $ php -f cake/console/cake.php graph /tmp/my_models.svg svg

No special magic is done about the filename.  What You Give Is What You Get.  As for the
format, you can use anything that GraphViz supports and understands.

If you are still looking for more control, have a look inside the script.  There are 
plenty of settings, options, parameters, and comments for you to make sense of it all. It
might be helpful to get familiar with GraphViz Dot Language, just to feel a tiny bit more
confident.

Enjoy!
